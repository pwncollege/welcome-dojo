SENSAI is an AI-powered tutoring system designed to provide customized feedback and support to you while you're working through challenges. It works by understanding what you're doing by looking at your terminal and files, enabling it to give you helpful and personalized guidance. SENSAI is limited to assisting you with the specific challenge that you're working on, and won't provide you with a direct solution. Instead, SENSAI will attempt to help you think through the problem and is intended to support you in finding the answer on your own.

We've created a set of three challenges meant to introduce you to SENSAI's capabilities, including understanding how SENSAI leverages your terminal and file context to better assist you.

**NOTE:** SENSAI is an ongoing research project at Arizona State University, and is being run under an IRB protocol.
