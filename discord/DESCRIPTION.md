Every hacker dons a white belt when they first enter the dojo.
To truly earn yours, you should join the community as well as hack the challenges.
Our community lives on [the pwn.college discord server](https://discord.gg/pwncollege).

Our discord is a core part of the pwn.college experience.
It is where you go to get help, guidance, and advice with the material, to chat about your building excitement for cybersecurity, and to celebrate the achievements of yourself and other hackers on the platform.
It is where you go to laugh, cry, and love.
It is where exceptional hackers with colorful belts meet in secret belt-only channels to discuss hacker arcana.
It is where the hackers are, and where you want to be.

You gain entrance to the full functionality of the discord server by connecting your pwn.college account to your Discord account.
You do that [here](https://pwn.college/settings#discord)!
Click through, connect your discord, and don your white belt!
