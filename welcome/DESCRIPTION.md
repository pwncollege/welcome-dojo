This module contains challenges that will teach you to interact with the platform!

You can interact with challenges in four ways:

- You can use the Terminal, a simple commandline interface running right in your web browser.
- You can use the Visual Studio Code, a full-featured Integrated Development Environment right in your browser.
- You can use a full Linux GUI desktop, again, running right in your browser
- You can set up your ssh client and ssh in.

We'll run you through the first three in this module, and show off some other features of the platform!

Below, you will see a list of learning `Resources` and a set of practice problems (`Challenges`).
Each entry in the list is expandable: click/tap on it to expand the content.
You can go ahead and watch the introductory lecture videos below, or dive straight into the `Using the Terminal` challenge!
