Throughout your pwn.college journey, you will have countless interactions with the Linux terminal, colloquially termed the "shell".
If you don't yet know the Art of the Shell, fear not, you will!
For now, we'll just focus on _launching_ it.

We make launching the terminal easy: when you start a challenge, we do it for you!
Just click `▶ Start` below, and this challenge will start.
Once it's loaded, the terminal will appear automatically right under this text, and you will be granted your first flag!

**Flag?**
As a reminder, this platform uses flags to track your progress.
Flags are cryptographic tokens that are given to you when you solve challenges.
Once you see it, copy-paste it into the submission box below and submit!
Then, once you get the confirmation that the flag was correct, move on to the next challenge!

**Try it now:** launch the terminal, copy the flag (drag-selecting it with your mouse will automatically copy it to your clipboard), and paste it into the `Flag` textbox below!
