This challenge will teach you to use the Visual Studio Code workspace.
You can start this challenge using the Start button below.
When it starts, you'll probably see the Terminal, like the previous level.
This time, though, the challenge will refuse to give you the flag until you switch to vscode!

You can use the workspace selector on the bar below the Terminal (e.g., the button that says "Terminal") to select "Code" and bring up the Visual Studio Code interface in place of the terminal.
Again, you can use it as-is, or you can click the "fullscreen" button (⛶) to full-screen the interface for more room.

Once VSCode loads, launch a terminal (press `Control-Shift-Backtick` or click the `☰` button in VSCode's left panel, and select the Terminal menu, and click New Terminal).
When we detect that you have launched the terminal in VSCode, we will give you the flag!

----
**NOTE:**
The pwn.college dojo will remember what the last workspace interface (Terminal, VSCode, etc.) you used, and will default to that, so the next challenge you run will now launch VSCode by default until you switch.
