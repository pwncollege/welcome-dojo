    type: markdown
    content: |
      In order to ssh into your challenge instances, you must link a public ssh key to your account [through your settings](/settings#ssh-key).
      You can quickly generate an ssh key by running `ssh-keygen -f key -N ''` in a terminal on your (unix-friendly) host machine.
      This will generate files `key` and `key.pub`, which are your private and public keys respectively.
      Once you have linked your *public* ssh key to your account, you can connect to the dojo over ssh with `ssh -i key hacker@pwn.college`.
  - name: "The VM"
    type: markdown
    content: |
      For some of the later (kernel-focused) challenges, you will need to solve the challenge in a virtual machine.
      You can interact with the virtual machine using the `vm` command.
